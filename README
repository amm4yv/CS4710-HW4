CS4710 - Classifier

All of our classifiers use the two helper classes, FeatureHeader.java and DataSet.java.
The modified training data files are used in our implementation under the trainingData folder,
so, to run please pass "trainingData/census.train" to our classifier.
We would like the Naive Bayes (BayesClassifier.java) to be entered into the competition.
